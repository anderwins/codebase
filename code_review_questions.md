# Code Review Questions

## Questions regarding `AudioPlayerController.java`

### Error Handling
1.  In `playFile` and `playStream`, errors are logged, and alerts are shown, but then the player is often reset, or a new `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown. Could these errors be handled more gracefully? Could specific exceptions be caught and handled differently?
2.  Is it sufficient for `media.setOnError(...)` and `mediaPlayer.setOnError(...)` lambdas to only log errors, or should they trigger more visible user notifications or state changes?

### Resource Management
3.  How is it ensured that the `shutdown()` method for the `scheduler` is always called when `AudioPlayerController` is no longer needed? What are the consequences if it's missed?
4.  Are there edge cases where `mediaPlayer` in `reset()` might not be fully cleaned up? Why is `mediaPlayer.setOnEndOfMedia(null)` called in `reset()`?

### State Management
5.  Are the `isPlaying` and `isPaused` boolean flags robust enough for managing player state, especially with async operations? Could an enum for states (e.g., `IDLE`, `PLAYING`, `PAUSED`) be more appropriate?

### Code Duplication & Refactoring
6.  How could the common logic in `playStream()` and `playFile()` for `MediaPlayer` initialization and error handling be refactored to reduce duplication?
7.  Regarding `onPrevious()` and `onNext()` methods, why are these separate methods executing runnables, rather than a more generic event subscription or direct management by collaborators?

### Lyrics Fetching (`showLyrics` method)
8.  Could the complex multi-step logic in `showLyrics` be broken down into smaller helper methods for better readability/testability?
9.  Could the synchronous online call `lrcLibService.searchAndSaveLyrics(track)` block the UI? If so, how should it be handled?
10. What are potential issues with string concatenation for building lyrics file paths, especially concerning platform differences or special characters?
11. Could multiple alerts from `showLyrics` during various failure points lead to alert fatigue?

### Concurrency
12. When the `progressUpdater` (from `scheduler`) calls `viewController.updateProgress`, is this UI update always correctly routed to the JavaFX Application Thread (e.g., via `Platform.runLater`)?
13. Is `Platform.runLater` consistently used for all UI updates originating from background tasks?

### Magic Numbers/Strings & Configuration
14. Would it be better to define magic numbers (e.g., `progressUpdateRate = 100`, `fade = 15`) as named constants? Why?
15. How does using string literals for logging and `AlertManager` messages affect maintainability and internationalization?

### Testing
16. How would you unit test methods like `playFile`, especially its error handling and state changes, using the `MediaPlayerFactory`?
17. What are the challenges in testing the fade-in/fade-out logic?

### Miscellaneous
18. For events like "onEnd," would a list of observers be more flexible than a single `Runnable` if multiple components need notification?
19. Could the naming of `stopFade` boolean and `setFade()` method be clarified for better intuitiveness (e.g., `isFadeEnabled`, `toggleFadeEffect()`)?
20. Is the declared `balanceThread` field used, or is it old code?

## Questions regarding `DbManager.java`

### Error Handling
1.  Is returning -1 from `getId` sufficient to distinguish "not found" from a database error? Should a custom exception be thrown for `SQLException`?
2.  How would a client of `getId` differentiate -1 meaning "not found" versus "an error occurred"?

### Resource Management (Connection Handling)
3.  Who is responsible for opening the connection passed to `DbManager`? Who is responsible for calling `closeConnection()`?
4.  What happens if `closeConnection()` is called multiple times? Are try-with-resources patterns used by client code to ensure connections are always closed?
5.  `PreparedStatement` and `ResultSet` in `getId` are well-managed with try-with-resources. Is this consistent across all subclasses for all DB resources?

### SQL Injection Prevention
6.  `getId` uses `PreparedStatement`. What ensures the SQL strings loaded from `Config.COMMON_QUERIES_SQL_FILE` are secure and not built unsafely before loading?
7.  Are all subclasses of `DbManager` consistently using `PreparedStatement` for all data-handling operations?

### Abstraction Design
8.  What is the intended purpose of `DbManager` being abstract if its main lookup methods are concrete? What abstract methods are subclasses expected to implement?
9.  What happens if `Config.COMMON_QUERIES_SQL_FILE` (used by `SQLLoader`) is missing or contains malformed queries?

### Temporary Dependencies / Design Concerns
10. Why are `trackLibrary` and `changes` fields considered temporary or misplaced in `DbManager`? Where might be a more appropriate location, and what design principles are at play?

### Connection Management
11. Since `connection` is `protected`, can subclasses directly manipulate it (commit, rollback)? What's the transaction management strategy?

## General Project Questions

### Logging Strategy
1.  What is the configured logging level for `java.util.logging`? Is it environment-configurable? Where do logs go? Is there log rotation?
2.  Are there clear developer guidelines for what to log and at which level?
3.  In `AudioPlayerController`, `Logger.getLogger(DbInitializer.class.getName())` is used. Is this intentional or a mistake?

### Configuration Management (`Config.java`)
4.  How are configuration values in `Config.java` stored/loaded (hardcoded, file, env vars)? How easy is it to change them without recompiling?
5.  What happens if `Config.setUpFolders()` fails?

### Modularity and Separation of Concerns
6.  How strictly is separation of concerns enforced between layers (controller, DAO, service, view)? Do controllers directly access DAOs?
7.  Are there any classes that seem to have too many responsibilities (potential "god classes")?
8.  Why are both Jackson and Gson JSON libraries included as dependencies? Could the project standardize?

### Internationalization (i18n)
9.  How are user-facing strings managed via `LanguageManager` and `src/main/resources/i18n/`? How is the current locale set?
10. Are all user-visible strings (e.g., in `AlertManager`) correctly internationalized using this system?

### Overall Testing Strategy
11. What's the reason for having both JUnit 4 and JUnit 5? Is there a migration or specific uses for each?
12. `mockito-inline` is used for static mocking. How does the prevalence of static methods affect testability?
13. What is the extent of UI test coverage with TestFX? Are critical workflows covered?
14. Is there a strategy for unit vs. integration tests (e.g., are DAOs tested against a real test database)? Is test coverage measured?

### Build and Dependency Management
15. Are any specific Java 21 features being utilized that are worth discussing?
16. Why is `maven-shade-plugin` used? What is the effect of its configuration (`createDependencyReducedPom=false`, `shadedArtifactAttached=false`)?

### Database
17. Why are dependencies for both MySQL and SQLite included? Are they used for different purposes or to offer choice?
18. How is the database schema managed (migrations, initial setup)? What roles do `DbInitializer` and `DatabaseSeeder` play?

## Detailed Technical Questions

1.  **`AudioPlayerController.java` - `showLyrics` Method Complexity & Error Handling:**
    The method `ulb.controller.AudioPlayerController#showLyrics(Track track)` involves multiple steps to find lyrics (local .lrc, local .txt, online search, then loading from the online-found path). Each step seems to have its own error logging and `AlertManager` calls.
    *   Critique this approach. Could this lead to a confusing user experience with multiple alerts?
    *   How could the error handling and reporting be centralized or made more user-friendly for this multi-step process?
    *   Does the synchronous call to `lrcLibService.searchAndSaveLyrics(track)` potentially block the UI thread? If so, what is the impact, and how should this be addressed?

2.  **`AudioPlayerController.java` - Logger Choice:**
    In `ulb.controller.AudioPlayerController`, the logger is initialized as `Logger.getLogger(DbInitializer.class.getName())`.
    *   Is there a specific reason for using `DbInitializer.class.getName()` here instead of `AudioPlayerController.class.getName()`?
    *   What are the implications of this choice for log analysis and filtering?

3.  **`DbManagerInsert.java` - `insertTrack` Method:**
    The `ulb.dao.DbManagerInsert#insertTrack(Track track)` method performs several checks and potential inserts (artist, album, tag) before inserting the track itself. Each of these operations might involve a separate query or `getId` call.
    *   Discuss the atomicity of this operation. What happens if, for example, `insertTrack` succeeds but the subsequent `insertTrackTag` fails?
    *   How does this sequence of individual checks and inserts affect performance, especially if adding many tracks?
    *   Could this method benefit from database transactions to ensure all related inserts succeed or fail together?

4.  **`DbManagerInsert.java` - Error Handling in `addTrackToPlaylist`:**
    In `ulb.dao.DbManagerInsert#addTrackToPlaylist(String playlistTitle, String trackTitle)`, a `SQLException` during the pre-check `SELECT 1 FROM PlaylistTrack WHERE playlist_id = ? AND track_id = ?` is caught, logged with a warning ("Erreur lors de la v√©rification de doublon dans la playlist"), and then the code proceeds to attempt the main insert.
    *   What are the potential consequences of ignoring this specific SELECT query failure and attempting the insert anyway?
    *   Is it safe to assume the track is not a duplicate if this check fails? What if the failure was due to a temporary connection issue that resolves before the insert?

5.  **`DbManager.java` - Ambiguity of `getId` Return Value:**
    The method `ulb.dao.DbManager#getId(String query, String parameter)` returns -1 if the entity is not found, but also returns -1 if a `SQLException` occurs during the query.
    *   How can a caller reliably distinguish between "not found" and "a database error occurred"?
    *   Why was this design chosen over, for example, throwing a custom `EntityNotFoundException` or re-throwing a `DbManagerException` in case of `SQLException`?

6.  **`DbManager.java` - "Temporary" Dependencies:**
    The `DbManager` class contains fields `protected TrackLibrary trackLibrary;` and `protected ChangeTracker changes;`, both commented with "// tmp, should be moved" or "// same".
    *   Why might these dependencies be considered "temporary" or misplaced within an abstract DAO manager class?
    *   What design principles (e.g., Single Responsibility Principle, Separation of Concerns) might be violated by their current placement? Where would be a more suitable location for managing these dependencies?

7.  **`model.Track.java` - Object Creation and Mutability:**
    The `ulb.model.Track` class does not use a Builder pattern, instead offering two constructors and an `assign(Track t)` method. Many setters like `setTitle()`, `setArtist()` also call `notifyChangeMetadata()`.
    *   What are the pros and cons of this constructor/setter/assign approach for `Track` objects compared to using an immutable Builder pattern, especially considering the `notifyChangeMetadata()` calls on individual setters?
    *   How does the current design impact the predictability of `Track` object states, particularly if they are shared or modified concurrently?

8.  **`MainController.java` - Constructor Responsibilities:**
    The constructor of `ulb.controller.MainController` is responsible for instantiating numerous other controllers (e.g.`HomeController`, `PlaylistController`, etc.) and associating them with views loaded via `mainViewController.addPage(...)`.
    *   What are the potential drawbacks of having such a "heavy" constructor in terms of testability, maintainability, and coupling?
    *   Could a dependency injection framework or a factory pattern simplify this setup and improve decoupling? Justify your answer.

9.  **`MainViewController.java` - FXML Loading and Controller Factories:**
    The `ulb.view.MainViewController#addPage(String fxmlFile, E id)` method uses `FXMLLoader` to load FXML files but does not use `FXMLLoader#setControllerFactory(...)`.
    *   What is the purpose of `FXMLLoader#setControllerFactory`?
    *   What benefits might have been missed by not using it here, for example, in terms of managing dependencies for the controllers being loaded (like `HomeViewController`, `PlaylistViewController`, etc.)?

10. **`Config.java` - Configuration Management & Error Handling:**
    The `ulb.Config` class uses public static final fields for configuration and has a static `setUpFolders()` method. If `setUpFolders()` fails, `Main.java` catches `Config.CouldNotSetUpDataFolder` and the application exits via `return;` in `main`.
    *   Discuss the testability and flexibility of using public static fields for configuration versus an instance-based configuration object (possibly read from a properties file).
    *   Is silently exiting the application in `Main.java` if `Config.setUpFolders()` fails the most appropriate error handling strategy? What are the alternatives and their implications?

11. **Testing Policy and Coverage (General Question):**
    The `pom.xml` includes TestFX, JUnit 5, and Mockito.
    *   What was the general testing policy for this project? For example, what determined if a class or method required a unit test, an integration test, or a UI test (using TestFX)?
    *   Are there any critical components or functionalities that you know are not currently covered by automated tests? Why might this be the case, and what are the associated risks? (This is a self-reflection question for the original developers).

12. **`LanguageManager.java` - Singleton Usage:**
    In `MainViewController.java`, `LanguageManager.getInstance()` is used, suggesting it's implemented as a Singleton.
    *   What are the benefits of using the Singleton pattern for `LanguageManager` in this application?
    *   What are the potential drawbacks or criticisms of using Singletons, particularly concerning testability and global state?
